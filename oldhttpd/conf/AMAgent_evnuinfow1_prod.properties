#
# The FQDN Map is a simple map that enables the Agent to take corrective
# action in the case where the users may have typed in an incorrect URL
# such as by specifying partial hostname or using an IP address to
# access protected resources.  It redirects the browser to the URL
# with fully qualified domain name so that cookies related to the domain
# are received by the agents.
#
# The format for this property is:
#
# com.sun.am.policy.agents.config.fqdn.map = [invalid_hostname|valid_hostname][,...]
#
# This property can also be used so that the agents use the name specified
# in this map instead of the web server's actual name. This can be
# accomplished by doing the following.
# Say you want your server to be addressed as xyz.hostname.com whereas the
# actual name of the server is abc.hostname.com.  The browsers only knows
# xyz.hostname.com and you have specified polices using xyz.hostname.com at
# the Access Manager policy console, in this file set the mapping as
#
# com.sun.am.policy.agents.fqdn.map = valid|xyz.hostname.com
#
# Another example is if you have multiple virtual servers say rst.hostname.com,
# uvw.hostname.com and xyz.hostname.com pointing to the same actual server
# abc.hostname.com and each of the virtual servers have their own policies 
# defined, then the fqdnMap should be defined as follows:
#
# com.sun.am.policy.agents.fqdn.map = valid1|rst.hostname.com,valid2|uvw.hostname.com,valid3|xyz.hostname.com
#
# WARNING: Invalid value for this property can result in the Web Server
# becoming unusable or the resources becoming inaccessible.

# Cookie Reset
# This property must be set to true, if this agent needs to
# reset cookies in the response before redirecting to
# Access Manager for Authentication.
# By default this is set to false.
#
# Example  : com.sun.am.policy.agents.config.cookie.reset.enable=true
#
com.sun.am.policy.agents.config.cookie.reset.enable = false

# This property gives the comma separated list of Cookies, that
# need to be  included in the Redirect Response to Access Manager.
# This property is used only if the  Cookie Reset feature is enabled. 
#
# The  Cookie details need to be  specified in the following Format 
# name[=value][;Domain=value]
#
# If "Domain" is not specified, then the default agent domain is
# used to set the Cookie. 
#
# Example : com.sun.am.policy.agents.config.cookie.reset.list=LtpaToken,
#           token=value;Domain=subdomain.domain.com
com.sun.am.policy.agents.config.cookie.reset.list = 

# This property gives the space separated list of domains in
# which cookies have to be set in a CDSSO scenario. This property
# is used only if CDSSO is enabled. 
#
# If this property is left blank then the fully qualified cookie
# domain for the agent server will be used for setting the cookie
# domain.  In such case it is a host cookie instead of a domain cookie.
#
# Example : com.sun.am.policy.agents.config.cookie.domain.list=.sun.com .iplanet.com 
com.sun.am.policy.agents.config.cookie.domain.list =

#
# Boolean attribute to indicate whether the path info and query should

# of the not enforced list when those URLs have a wildcard '*' character.
# For security reason this property should be set to true in order to avoid 
# situation like the following one: if
# com.sun.am.policy.agents.config.notenforced_list = http://host/*.gif
# someone can access http://host/index.html by using the request URL
# http://host/index.html/hack.gif.

# Not enforced list is the list of URLs for which no authentication is
# required.  Wildcards can be used to define a pattern of URLs.
# The URLs specified may not contain any query parameters.
# Each service have their own not enforced list.  The service name is suffixed
# after "com.sun.am.policy.agents.notenforcedList." to specify a list
# for a particular service.  SPACE is the separator between the URL.

#   Example: client, proxy1, proxy2...
#
#   If only client IP HTTP header available, then web agents can get the client
#   hostname by using com.sun.identity.agents.config.get.client.host.name property.
#
#   Note that in some cases client IP may not always represent actual requesting client,
#   rather proxy server. If a web browser using a proxy, then client IP value may be the
#   value of the proxy, unless that proxy supports the same HTTP header.
#   Example case 1: Client browser(using direct access) -> Proxy/LB -> Agent =>  Atcual client IP
#   Example case 2: Client browser(using proxy) -> Proxy/LB -> Agent =>  Client IP of browser's proxy.
#
#   - client.ip.header: Specifies a HTTP header name that holds the IP
#     address of the client. May be left blank if not used.
#   - client.hostname.header: Specifies a HTTP header name that holds the
#     Hostname of the client. May be left blank if not used.
#   com.sun.am.policy.agents.config.client.ip.header = X-Forwarded-For
#   com.sun.am.policy.agents.config.hostname.header =
#   
#   The previous property agent.load_balancer has to be enabled to use any of these 2 properties
